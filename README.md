This is the implementation code of the paper "Improving Chinese Pop Song and Hokkien Gezi Opera Singing Voice Synthesis by Enhancing Local Modeling".

We are particularly grateful to the [DiffSinger](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger) project as we have made modifications and conducted experiments based on their code.

We have built a Gezi Opera dataset. If you are only using it for research, you can send an email to me and I will apply for authorization from teacher. We have an agreement with the data recording people.
